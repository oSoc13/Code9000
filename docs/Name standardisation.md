# Name standardisation of #code9000

The name of the project itself is called #code9000, and the resulting applications are called the *9K Spotter* and the *9K Builder*.

## 9K Spotter

9K Spotter is an application intended to allow citizens of Ghent to provide location-based feedback to the city of Ghent.

### Spottings

#### Defining “Issues” and “Solutions”

A user can select a **location** in Ghent (by entering the street name or by using location data) in order to **solve a problem**. This problem is called **an issue**. Before a user can provide this feedback, he also needs to **suggest a solution**. The combination of an issue and a proposed solution is a **spotting**.

#### Interacting with Spottings

A user can optionally attach one or more pictures via the uploader. Other users can leave feedback on suggested solutions: they can press a plus or minus button. If a user presses the plus button, the user thinks it is a **good solution**. If not, it is a **bad solution**. Users can also provide **alternate solutions** for a spotting. The most liked solution appears at the top near the spottings. Users can also **comment** on spottings and solutions.

#### A Short Recap

For clarity’s sake: **multiple** spottings can be assigned to a **single location**. And each spotting contains multiple solutions (with respective likes and comments on each solution, where the most liked solution is the one that is sent to the people of Ghent.).

#### Official Replies

City representatives can also comment on on spottings, and provide information about the city’s plans to act on a certain spotting.

This is an **official reply**. When the city updates the issue with a progress report, the spotting becomes featured (for visibility).

## 9K Builder

The Builder allows users of the 9K Spotter to adapt and design their environments.

When the city opens up a plot of land or a location, users can have at it with the 9K Builder. This is an isometric city builder with some cool functionality. The 9K Builder might not be finished at the project deadline.
